Part 1 (Encoder Trained With Classifier)
    For running the enocder training please do the following steps:
        - comment lines [22, 23], and uncomment line [24].
        - make sure lines [159-168] is commented.
        - make sure lines [186-249] is commented and make sure lines [113-180] are uncomemnted.
        - do python main.py
Part 2 (Pretraining Decoder Language Model)
    For running the decoder training please do the following steps:
        - comment lines [113-180], make sure lines [186-249] is uncommented.
        - comment lines [23, 24], and uncomment line [22].
        - make sure lines [159-168] is commented.
        - do python main.py
